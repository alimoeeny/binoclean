Things that need fixing:
* FSD drop down and XYL and XYR check boxes (problems seems to be in verge)
* go check box seems to get out of date in verge or out of sync somehow
* we get into this mode like an interleave blank after one trial and the stimulus turns back on (when we set it to none initially)
* solved 2/24/12 - fixation point is turned off for unknown reasons
* options popup must be set correctly otherwise unsets things if change
* graticule on eye tracking  THis is a spike2 problem when it gets xylim = 0. Need to recalc grid each time maybe
* integrate with psych mon
* make the verge window size larger
* jv keeps reseting to zero
- save and save as in verg 
* stepper (openserial, +-5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200) in binoc lean
* penetration log in binoc lean
* information line (at the bottom of the main classic binoc window) should be moved both the verg and binoc lean
* cancel button does not update at the end of an experiment
* add ablksize control to verg. code is "bs"
* acknowledge should popup a visual alert.
* psychmon does not take into account the second experiment (plots only one line while it should plot 3)
* psychmon does not show the number of repetitions of each condition correctly
* psychmon resets for each experiment (it should reset only if the experiment type is changed)
* we need a "PCLEAR" button.
* in addition to "PSYCH"mon it would be nice to have all the other types of plots orientation tuning, dx tuning ... 
* display these (verge or binoc): total Number of trials, trials done so far, time lapsed, time since the end of the last experiment
* keep list of quickexpts in binoc to feed to verg.
* expt cancel often doesn't work
* Verg needs to send back \mimic
- Electrode Position does not update on the display
- uDrive commands larger than 300 should be confimed not rejected
- uDrive commands that are rejected should be reverted (not applied to the variable)
- warning if can't open penlog
* if cant cwd, cwd to /local
* make sure exceptions are handled properly in updateInfoText in mainGUI and in case of a problem it should Log it to console.
* quick expts in autosave files
* rds6.4 resets sl to 1
* stop redundant calls to info.
* monocRC Fast seq doesn't work, and blank is not in stim list. 
* AFC shows set but is not after loading lem bwlatest
* turning of hx doesn't always work - eg from bwlatest to plaidor45
* vhpos expt type not implemented
* why doenst keyboard tab work when binoclean is running
* turn off screensaver in binoc
* in verg, remove stepper from the pop menu
* Quitting with command-Q now leaves DIO in bad state
* in verg turning the right eye / left eye markers gets confused 
* possible to allow drag and drop of stim files?
* handle quit commands comming from verg
* change all the recovery file extension to .stm 
* handle quit commands comming from verg
* change all the recovery file extension to .stm 
* in the PsychMon window add a list (history) of experiments to the Expt menu
* Add a vertical line at 0 and a horizontal line at 0.5 on psychmon plot that verg displays
* increase the font size in verg window
* in the PsychMon window add a list (history) of experiments to the Expt menu
* cd paint_targ Add a vertical line at 0 and a horizontal line at 0.5 on psychmon plot that verg displays
* subroutine that allows text display in opengl window for bgc to call [it is printStringOnMonkeyView in binoc.c]
* acknokege to print to command history pane in red
* stop filtering messages for status line
-total reward given in verg or binoc window
*fix color scheme for lines printed to monkey view
-make sure setup file saving works.
*allow verg to run a sequnce of experiments with changes. ? from a window or from a text file?  ? make it a qe type?
-could binoc write to pipe when started so that verg automatically reopens pipes? 
*when verg connects to a running binoc which is mid expt, get vert to know and set Run button
*stausline only on alternate frames in expt/ But thats ok
*when rpt is on, make expts separte for the psych plot (currently all lumped into one)
*expt labels in verg when expt type not in list.
*check Buts expts expt2 setups
*fixation off color no longer works....
*if a code is not recognized, verg should not echo its local value?
* need to make cursor invisible in Red and Blue  !!!NB IMPORTANT FOR HUMAN PSYCH
* allow polling to see if mouse events are in queue for human pshychophysics
- find cocoa command to get current monitor icc info
* For james. Ecah vary orientation randomly by frame. Orthogonal.
*    Allow multiple bars per frame. B or W.
* For manual expts make a useful statusline
-if manual list of exp stims, verg doesn't send to binoc when reopen pipes
-last stim in an expt does not get a reward.....
-History search/arrow navigation should read in from binoccmd histroy too
-add et,e2,e3 to R4 lines, so that PsychMon can see expts. 
-!mat commands only if not run from sequnce loop
-have reset expt done by a file read from disk.
-handle more expts than 3 in manual expts.
*backgr contrast should not be 0 at start time
