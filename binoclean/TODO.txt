Things that need fixing:
* FSD drop down and XYL and XYR check boxes (problems seems to be in verge)
* go check box seems to get out of date in verge or out of sync somehow
- we get into this mode like an interleave blank after one trial and the stimulus turns back on (when we set it to none initially)
* solved 2/24/12 - fixation point is turned off for unknown reasons
* options popup must be set correctly otherwise unsets things if change
- graticule on eye tracking  THis is a spike2 problem when it gets xylim = 0. Need to recalc grid each time maybe
- integrate with psych mon
* make the verge window size larger
- Ali:THIS PROBLEM IS NOT RESOLVED - jv keeps reseting to zero
- save and save as in verg 
- stepper (openserial, +-5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200) in binoc lean
- penetration log in binoc lean
- information line (at the bottom of the main classic binoc window) should be moved both the verg and binoc lean
* cancel button does not update at the end of an experiment
* add ablksize control to verg. code is "bs"
* acknowledge should popup a visual alert.
- psychmon does not take into account the second experiment (plots only one line while it should plot 3)
- psychmon does not show the number of repetitions of each condition correctly
- psychmon resets for each experiment (it should reset only if the experiment type is changed)
- we need a "PCLEAR" button.
- in addition to "PSYCH"mon it would be nice to have all the other types of plots orientation tuning, dx tuning ...
