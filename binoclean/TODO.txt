Things that need fixing:
* FSD drop down and XYL and XYR check boxes (problems seems to be in verge)
* go check box seems to get out of date in verge or out of sync somehow
- we get into this mode like an interleave blank after one trial and the stimulus turns back on (when we set it to none initially)
* solved 2/24/12 - fixation point is turned off for unknown reasons
* options popup must be set correctly otherwise unsets things if change
- graticule on eye tracking  THis is a spike2 problem when it gets xylim = 0. Need to recalc grid each time maybe
- integrate with psych mon
* make the verge window size larger
* jv keeps reseting to zero
- save and save as in verg 
- stepper in binoc lean
- penetration log in binoc lean
- information line (at the bottom of the main classic binoc window) should be moved both the verg and binoc lean
* cancel button does not update at the end of an experiment
* add ablksize control to verg. code is "bs"
